# Checkers_AI
A checkers game AI which plays against human players,calculating it's move after each subsequent human move.
Download the files and run 'main_code.py'. The GUI will prompt you to select the algorithm by which you want the computer to play(minmax or alpha-beta pruning). After selecting one of the two options click on "Start Game" and wait for CPU to make it's move.(The code which allows humans to play first will be added soon).
